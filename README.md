For now it is like a playground.
I aim to implement algorithms from Andrew Ng's course from coursera in a most possible low level way.
But codes will be in tensorflow and python. The purpose of it is that next projects, next repos in my profile 
will be in Python and Tensorflow and using some High Level APIs and custom models.
I will try to explain what is the math behind the code in this repository. 
I hope it will help someone and enjoy coding!
